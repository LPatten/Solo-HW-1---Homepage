              <div>Since 2007, Project Vote has provided the public with the tools to monitor the passage of voting rights laws across the country, with free access to our lists of bills and analyses.

              The interactive index of bills below is curated, analyzed, and summarized by Project Vote’s election administration experts, and regularly updated for you to access at any time. You can search by state and by issue, and track bills according to whether they are—in our analysis—likely to help or hinder the ability of eligible Americans to vote.</div>

                <div>The U.S. Congress Votes Database documents every vote and member of the House and Senate since 1991. Data is pulled from several sources, including the House clerk, the U.S. Senate and the Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress. For the 112th Congress, users can analyze members and votes by various metrics, including caucus affiliations, 2010 margin of victory, and members endorsed by Tea Party Express or Freedom Works during the 2010 campaign.
